++++[>++++[>+++<-]<-] initializes cell(2) with the value 48, which is the ASCII value for '0'.

,>,> reads two numbers from the input and stores them in cell(0) and cell(1).

[<-<->>-] decrements the values in cell(0) and cell(1) by 48 (to convert from ASCII to actual numbers).

<<[> [>+>+<<-] >> [<<+>>-] <<<-] is a loop for multiplication. It multiplies the numbers in cell(0) and cell(1) and stores the result in cell(1).

>[-]< resets cell(1) to 0.

++++[>++++[>+++<-]<-] adds 48 to cell(2) to convert the result back to ASCII.

>>. prints the result.
